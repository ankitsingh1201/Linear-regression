# Linear-regression
1. Generate a simple data i.e. a matrix A with dimensions 100 × 2. Initialize it with normal distribution
   μ = 2 and σ = 0.01
2. Implement LEARN-SIMPLE-LINREG algorithm and train it using matrix A to learn values of β0
   and β1
3. Implement PREDICT-SIMPLE-LINREG and calculate the points for each training example in matrix A.
4. Plot the training points from matrix A and predicted values in the form of line graph.
5. In the end use numpy.linalg lstsq to replace step 2 for learning values of β0 and β1
